# Calorie Counter

Sometimes when you're coding a web application, you'll need to be able to accept input from a user. In this calorie counter project, you'll learn how to validate user input, perform calculations based on that input, and dynamically update your interface to display the results.

## Project Overview

In this practice project, you'll learn:

- **Basic Regular Expressions:** Use regular expressions to validate user input and ensure data integrity.
- **Template Literals:** Use template literals for creating dynamic and readable HTML and JavaScript code.
- **addEventListener() Method:** Learn how to add event listeners to handle user interactions with the web application.
- **Dynamic Interface Updates:** Update the web interface dynamically to display calculated results based on user input.

## Features

- **User Input Validation:** Ensure the input provided by the user meets the required format and constraints.
- **Calorie Calculation:** Perform calculations based on user input to determine the total calories.
- **Dynamic Updates:** Display the calculated results immediately within the web application interface.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/calorie-counter.git
# Calorie Counter

Open the Project:
Navigate to the project directory and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## How to Use

1. **Enter Data:**
   - Provide the necessary input data in the designated fields (e.g., food item, quantity, calories per unit).

2. **Submit:**
   - Click the "Calculate" button to validate the input and perform the calorie calculation.

3. **View Results:**
   - The calculated total calories will be displayed dynamically on the interface.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structure the web application.
- **CSS:** Style the application and make it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript:** Handle user input, validation, calculations, and dynamic updates.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Understand how to use regular expressions for input validation.
- Learn how to use template literals to create dynamic content.
- Gain experience with event handling using the `addEventListener()` method.
- Enhance your skills in dynamically updating the web interface based on user interactions.
